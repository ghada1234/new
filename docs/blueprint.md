## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(100, 70%, 50%) which converts to a vibrant, food-themed green (#33cc1a). This should give a friendly, energetic feel, and avoid the money/finance associations of many common greens.
- Background color: HSL(100, 20%, 90%) which converts to a very light, desaturated green (#e5f2e0). This creates a calm, appetizing backdrop that does not distract from the main UI elements.
- Accent color: HSL(70, 70%, 40%) which converts to a dark yellow-green (#6bb313), for buttons and highlights. This provides contrast without clashing, drawing user attention to areas for interaction.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a bold, computerized feel. Paired with 'PT Sans' for longer body text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different nutrient groups and food categories. Icons from lucide-react.
- Dashboard provides intuitive visualization of user intake, goals and gaps. Menu bar on left for the main application functions. The dashboard should have intuitive visualizations of user intake, goals and gaps.
- Subtle transitions and animations when navigating between screens and updating data.
