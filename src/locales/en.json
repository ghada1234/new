  "aboutMeDescription": "My name is Ghada Alani. My journey into the world of nutrition began not in a lab, but in my grandmother's kitchen. It was a place of warmth, laughter, and incredible food that told the stories of our heritage. But as I grew older, I realized that while our family meals were rich in tradition, they were a mystery in terms of nutrition. I embarked on a personal quest to understand the food I loved, a journey that took me through bustling international markets and deep into the world of data and technology. I wanted to find a way to honor our culinary traditions while embracing a healthier, more informed way of living.",
